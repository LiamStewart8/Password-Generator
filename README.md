# Password-Generator
Are you in need of a quick and easy passowrd generator? Well you have come to the right place. This password generator that I have developed will generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters. This may contain **upper-case** letters, **lower-case** letters, **numbers**, and **special characters**.
